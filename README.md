To play around with my code follow these instructions:

* In your terminal in the directory you wish run

```
* git clone https://github.com/velvetsnowman/notesapp.git
* cd notesapp
```
```
* irb
* require './lib/notebook.rb'
* notebook = Notebook.new
* notebook.notebook_menu

```

* You should see something like this:

```
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. INPUT A NEW NOTE
2. SHOW ME ALL MY NOTES
3. PICK A NOTE
4. SAVE MY NOTES
5. LOAD MY SAVED NOTES
9. EXIT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```
* Within your terminal, type the number of the option you wish to choose, I recommend inputting `1`

As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order

As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered
